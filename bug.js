This error occurs when you try to access a property of an object that is null or undefined. This is a common error in React Native, especially when dealing with asynchronous data fetching or working with navigation parameters.

Example:
```javascript
// Incorrect code
const userName = this.props.user.name;
```

This will throw an error if `this.props.user` is null or undefined.  The error message will typically indicate a `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name')` or a similar message indicating the property being accessed is undefined.
